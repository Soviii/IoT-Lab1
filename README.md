# IoT-Lab1 (by Sophia Canja & Sovial Sonzeu)

## General Information
We followed very similar wiring to the designs shown in the lab 1 information. The purpose of this lab was to use the Adafruit CAP1188 touch sensor in two different ways - I2C and Software SPI. With different wiring configurations, we were able to demonstrate the same functionality but in two different manners.
